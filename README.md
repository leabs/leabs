I’m a web developer focused on creating secure, high-performance websites and web apps. My expertise lies in building frontends for apps, primarily Internet of Things (IoT) dashboards, though I also enjoy exploring new challenges and sharing projects on **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@shadowstack)**. I am currently open to a full-time remote role if I’m a good fit for the company.
